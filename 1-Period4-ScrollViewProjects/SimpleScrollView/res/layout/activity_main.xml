Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React[8]) or native code (via LLVM); e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.[9] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.[10]  On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.[11] Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 6 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 8 up to 15, for optimization,[12] or allows for more features, e.g. Java 8 related with Kotlin 1.4,[13] and has experimental record class support for Java 16 compatibility.[14]  Kotlin support for JavaScript (i.e. classic back-end) is considered stable in Kotlin 1.3 by its developers, while Kotlin/JS (IR-based) in version 1.4, is considered alpha.
